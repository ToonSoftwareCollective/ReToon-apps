# Writing an app

An app is a folder with a `manifest.json` and one JavaScript file. It draws
its own card on a page of the Toon's screen, and optionally a full screen
that opens when the card is tapped.

The quickest start is to copy [`example-app`](example-app) and change it.

[Using AI](#using-ai) below.

## Where it runs

Apps run inside the Toon's screen program, in QuickJS (modern JavaScript,
ES2023). Each app has its own JavaScript runtime:

- 24 MB of memory, and at most 2 seconds for each call into the app.
- One file of code: there is no `import`, `require` or `export`, and no
  second file can be loaded.
- No browser: no DOM, no `window`, no `fetch`, no `localStorage`, no `Intl`.
  An app cannot reach files or start programs. It has only what is listed
  below.
- The Toon has one slow CPU core. Drawing costs real time, see
  [Drawing efficiently](#drawing-efficiently).

## The folder

```
my-app/
  manifest.json
  main.js
```

The folder name is the app's `id`: lower case letters, digits and `-`.

### manifest.json

```json
{
	"id": "my-app",
	"name": "My app",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"api": 2,
	"main": "main.js",
	"description": "One or two sentences. Shown in the web interface, above the settings.",
	"author": "Your name",
	"tile": { "height": 150 },
	"settings": [
		{ "key": "entity", "label": "Temperature sensor", "type": "entity", "units": ["°C"] },
		{ "key": "title", "label": "Title", "type": "text", "default": "Outside" },
		{ "key": "warn", "label": "Warn above (°C)", "type": "number", "default": 25 },
		{ "key": "big", "label": "Big numbers", "type": "bool", "default": true }
	]
}
```

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `id` | The folder name |
| `name` | Shown in the web interface and above the full screen |
| `version` | `"1.2.3"`. Raise it with every change: the Toons offer an update when the catalogue's version is higher |
| `api` | The level of the interface the app needs, see [API levels](#api-levels) |
| `main` | The code file, in the folder |
| `description`, `author` | Shown in the web interface |
| `tile.height` | The card's height in screen pixels (60–520, default 150). A page can override it with `"height"` on the card |
| `settings` | What the user can set in the web interface, see below |

### Settings

The web interface makes a form from `settings`. The values are in
`retoon.settings`, by `key`: the saved value, or the `default`.

| `type` | Input | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | A text field | string |
| `secret` | A password field, for tokens and keys | string |
| `number` | A number field | number |
| `bool` | A check box | `true` / `false` |
| `entity` | One entity, picked from Home Assistant | entity id, e.g. `"sensor.outside"` |
| `entities` | A list of entities, each with extra `fields` (`text`, `number` or `bool`); also `max` and `addLabel` | `[{ "entity": "...", <field keys> }]` |

`units` (with `entity` and `entities`) limits the picker to entities in those
units, e.g. `["W", "kW"]`. See `powerflow/manifest.json` for an `entities`
setting with fields.

## The code

A card showing one temperature:

```js
const S = () => retoon.settings;

function draw(el) {
	const st = retoon.state(S().entity);
	const v = st ? st.value : NaN;
	el.text(S().title, { x: 0, y: 0, color: "muted" });
	el.text(isFinite(v) ? v.toFixed(1) + " °C" : "-", {
		align: "center", font: S().big ? "big" : "mid",
		color: v > S().warn ? "bad" : "text" });
}

function follow() {
	retoon.watch([S().entity], () => retoon.update());
}

retoon.tile(draw);
retoon.onSettings(() => { follow(); retoon.update(); });
follow();
```

The file runs once when the screen starts. It registers draw functions and
starts timers; the screen calls the draw functions whenever the card has to
be drawn.

### retoon

| | |
|---|---|
| `retoon.tile(fn)` | `fn(el, card)` draws the card. `card` is the card's configuration from the page (`{ type, app, height, ... }`) |
| `retoon.screen(fn)` | `fn(el)` draws the full screen. Without it, tapping the card does nothing. The screen has the app's name and a Close button above the drawing area |
| `retoon.update()` | Draw the card(s) and the open full screen again, soon (not during this call) |
| `retoon.settings` | The settings: saved values over the manifest's defaults |
| `retoon.onSettings(fn)` | `fn()` is called after the user saved new settings; `retoon.settings` already has them |
| `retoon.watch(ids, fn)` | Keep these entities up to date: Home Assistant entities, `mqtt.*` and the Toon's own `toon.*`. `fn(id)` is called when the state of one changes. A new call replaces the list |
| `retoon.state(id)` | `{ state, value, unit, name, attributes }`, or `null` when unknown. `state` is the text, `value` the state as a number (`NaN` if it is not one), `unit` the unit or `null`, `name` the friendly name. Only entities in a `watch` list are kept up to date |
| `retoon.fetch(url, opts)` | http or https. `opts`: `method`, `headers` (object), `body` (string), `timeout` (seconds, 1–120, default 30). A Promise of `{ status, text }`. It resolves for every HTTP status (check `status`) and rejects only when there was no answer. At most 4 MB |
| `retoon.notify(msg, fn)` | Show a message on the Toon: a banner at the top, or a popup in the middle (see [Notifications](#notifications)). `fn(button)` is called with the label of the tapped button, or with `null` when the message was closed without one. Returns `false` when `msg` is not an object |
| `retoon.sound(name, volume)` | Play `"beep"`, `"chime"` or a WAV file from the Toon's sound folder. `volume` 0–100 is optional (default: the Toon's sound setting) |
| `retoon.app` | `{ id, name, version }` |
| `retoon.log(...)`, `console.log(...)` | Print to the screen program's output, see [trying-an-app.md](trying-an-app.md) |
| `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval` | As in a browser |

### Notifications

`retoon.notify` takes the same message as Home Assistant sends to the Toon:

```js
retoon.notify({ title: "Cheap hour", message: "Electricity is cheapest from 14:00.",
	icon: "mdi:flash", tag: "cheap" });

retoon.notify({ title: "Bin day", message: "Put the green bin out tonight.",
	level: "warning", buttons: ["Done", "Remind me later"], tag: "bins" },
	button => retoon.log("answer: " + button));	// "Done", "Remind me later" or null
```

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `title`, `message` | The text; a message alone is fine |
| `level` | `"info"` (default), `"warning"` or `"alert"`: colour, icon and default sound |
| `icon` | An `mdi:` icon instead of the one for the level |
| `style` | `"banner"` or `"popup"`. Default: a popup for an alert, with buttons or with `timeout` 0, a banner otherwise |
| `timeout` | Seconds until it goes by itself, 0 = until tapped. Default 10 for a banner, 0 for a popup |
| `buttons` | Up to three labels (popup only) |
| `sound` | `"none"`, `"beep"`, `"chime"`, `"alarm"` (repeats while the popup is open) or a WAV file name. Default: none for info, beep for a warning, chime for an alert |
| `volume` | 0–100 |
| `tag` | A new message with the same tag replaces the old one; `{ tag: "bins", dismiss: true }` takes it away |
| `wake` | `false`: a dimmed screen stays dimmed |

A banner that is tapped opens as a popup. Use a `tag` for anything that can
come again, so the Toon shows the newest one instead of a pile, and keep
sounds for what really needs attention: the Toon hangs on a wall in
someone's living room.

### Drawing

A draw function gets `el`, an empty area. Everything drawn on it, or on
anything drawn on it, is an `el` again, so you can draw inside a box.
Positions are in pixels of the screen as if it is 1024 wide; on a Toon 1
(800 wide) everything is scaled. `(0, 0)` is the top left of the area.

| | |
|---|---|
| `el.width`, `el.height` | The size of the area. A card's area is the card minus 12 px padding; the full screen's area is about 990 × 520 |
| `el.box(opts)` | A rectangle, for backgrounds, bars and groups |
| `el.text(string, opts)` | Text. `font`, `textAlign` (`left`, `center`, `right`; needs `w`) |
| `el.button(label, opts, fn)` | A button, 48 px high; `fn()` on a tap |
| `el.icon("mdi:name", opts)` | A [Material Design icon](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/); `size`: `small` (26 px), `mid` (32), `big` (48) |
| `el.circle(opts)` | `x`, `y` are the centre, `r` the radius |
| `el.line([x1, y1, x2, y2, ...], opts)` | A line through these points (at least two); `width` (default 2), `color`, `opacity` |
| `el.flow(opts)` | Dots moving from `x1, y1` to `x2, y2` by themselves; `speed` in pixels a second (below 0 the other way, 0 still), `gap` (30), `size` (8), `color` |
| `el.onClick(fn)` | `fn()` when it is tapped |
| `el.set(opts)` | Change something already drawn: its options, a text's `text`, a flow's `speed` or `color` |

Options:

| | |
|---|---|
| `x`, `y` | The position. With `align`, the offset from that spot |
| `w`, `h` | The size; without it, a text or icon is as large as it needs |
| `align` | `top-left`, `top-mid`, `top-right`, `left-mid`, `center`, `right-mid`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-mid`, `bottom-right`, within the parent |
| `color` | Text, icon and line colour |
| `bg` | Background colour |
| `opacity` | 0–1 |
| `radius`, `border`, `borderColor` | Rounded corners, a border |
| `font` | `small` (16 px), `body` (19, the default), `head` (22, semibold), `mid` (34), `big` (78, light) |

Colours are `"#rrggbb"` or a theme name: `text`, `muted`, `accent`, `ok`,
`warn`, `bad`, `card`, `background`. The theme names follow the Toon's
colours, so use them where you can.

The font has Latin, Greek and Cyrillic letters and the usual symbols
(`°`, `€`, `–`, `…`), but no emoji.

### Drawing efficiently

`retoon.update()` throws away everything drawn before and calls the draw
functions again. That is fine every few seconds. For something that changes
several times a second, keep the element and change it with `el.set`:

```js
let clock = null;	// the text element of the last drawing

function tick() {
	if (clock) clock.set({ text: new Date().toTimeString().slice(0, 8) });
}
retoon.tile(el => {
	clock = el.text("", { align: "center", font: "mid" });
	tick();
});
setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

Other tips:

- Fetch in the background (on a timer) and keep the result in a variable;
  draw from that variable. Never fetch inside a draw function.
- Call `retoon.update()` once after a change, not once per value.
- Keep drawings small: a few dozen elements, not hundreds. For a bar graph,
  one `el.box` per bar is fine.

### Errors

When the code throws while starting or drawing, the card shows the error
instead. A failing fetch rejects its Promise: catch it, and draw a message
from a variable.

## API levels

The manifest's `api` is the lowest level of this interface the app needs. A
ReToon with a lower level does not offer the app for installing, and does not
start it.

| Level | Added |
|---|---|
| 1 | `retoon.tile`, `screen`, `update`, `settings`, `onSettings`, `fetch`, `app`, `log`, timers; `el.box`, `text`, `button`, `onClick`, `width`, `height` |
| 2 | `retoon.watch`, `retoon.state`; `el.icon`, `el.circle`, `el.line`, `el.flow`, `el.set` |
| 3 | `retoon.notify`, `retoon.sound` (ReToon 1.15 and later) |

## Trying it, and publishing it

Put the app on your own Toon over SSH while you work on it:
[trying-an-app.md](trying-an-app.md). When it works, add it to the catalogue
with a pull request, see the [README](../README.md#adding-your-app).

## Using AI

[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) in the root of this repository is written for AI
coding assistants: the complete interface, the rules, and a checklist.
Assistants that work in a copy of this repository (Claude Code, Codex,
Cursor, Copilot and others) read it by themselves. With a chat assistant,
attach or paste `AGENTS.md` and describe your app, for example:

> Write a ReToon app that shows the next three departures from my bus stop
> on the card, using this API: ... Follow AGENTS.md.

Then try the result on your Toon with [trying-an-app.md](trying-an-app.md),
and give the assistant whatever the card shows when something is wrong.
